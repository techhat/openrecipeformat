# Introduction to Git

Using a text-based format, especially YAML, provides a powerful platform for recipe management. Recipes are essentially source code, using a human compiler rather than a machine compiler. As such, they can benefit from many of the same tools as computer programming languages. One of these tools that can be especially powerful in kitchen lab environments and recipe development is version control. Unfortunately, most cooks are not used to using version control, especially git.

This document is currently targeted at developers and other technical professionals who are more used to using command line-based software. It assumes that the user has not previously used git, but can follow along with command line instructions. It was written for the Linux environment, but other Unices should not differ too terribly. Another guide, targeted at graphical environments such as Gnome, KDE and Windows, is planned.

Distributed Revision Control
============================

Classical revision control systems used a centralized repository server, from which a user could check out files, modify them, and check them back in. Some older systems, such as CVS, would maintain version numbers of the repository as a whole; even checking in changes to a single file would update the version of every file in the repository. Some newer systems such as Subversion would maintain individual version numbers on each file. In either case, the central repository server would manage the version numbers, and was the final word on conflicting versions of files that were checked in.

This scenerio was common in the software industry, and tended to work well for small software projects. However, it posed several limitations in larger organizations, which needed to handle multiple, disparate branches of a project in multiple, disparate locations. A distributed solution was needed. Several of these now exist, each with their own strengths. This guide focuses on git, partly because of its current popularity, and partly because of the author's own persional experience.

Git was written by Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux operating system kernel. It does not inherently assume a central repository, which controls all other checkouts of a project. Each user maintains their own repository, and with it the ability to send patches to another copy of the repository, and merge patches sent from another copy of the repository.

When a repository is copied from another source, it is known as a fork. The process of forking a repository in git uses the clone command. Forked repositories can pull changes from other forks, or from the repository that they were cloned from. Forks can also send changes upstream to the initial repository using, among other options, a "pull request", in which the initial repository pulls changes from a fork.

Confused yet? Don't worry, we'll take it step by step.

Initializing a Repo
===================

This guide assumes the use of GitHub, a popular site which maintains Git repositories (known as "repos"), using both free and paid models. There are other stellar hosting options available, but by and large the usage will be the same.

If you haven't already, go to <https://github.com/> and create an account. Once you have signed up, you need to create a new repo. In GitHub, the icon to create a new repo is located in the top-right corner of the page, and looks like a book with a plus sign on it. Call your repo "myrecipes", and go ahead and make it public.

Once the repo has been created on GitHub, you need to initialize it on your local machine.

``` shell
localhost> mkdir -p ~/git/myrecipes
localhost> cd ~/git/myrecipes
localhost> git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/larry/git/myrecipes/.git/
```

TODO: Push the repository to origin

Creating a Recipe
=================

We'll create a simple recipe, using your favorite text editor. This recipe will be saved as ~/git/myrecipes/apple.yaml:

``` shell
recipe_name: Giving an Apple to a Friend
ingredients:
    - apple:
        amounts:
            - amount: 1
              unit: each
steps:
    - step: Give an apple to a fiend.
```

You may notice that this recipe contains an inconsistency. Don't worry about it, we'll fix it up in just a moment. For now, we'll save the recipe, and then see what git has to say about it.

``` shell
localhost> git status
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#   apple.yaml
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Git can see that the file is there, but it's not currently tracking any changes to it. Let's add it, and see what git thinks about it.

``` shell
localhost> git add apple.yaml 
localhost> git status
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
#
#   new file:   apple.yaml
#
```

Git has now been notifed that apple.yaml is available to be added to the repo. However, it has not yet been checked in (or "committed", as git calls it), and so git is still not technically tracking changes to it. Let's go ahead and commit it.

``` shell
localhost> git commit -m 'This is my first commit'
[master (root-commit) 1617167] This is my first commit
 1 file changed, 8 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 apple.yaml
localhost> git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

The -m option designates a commit message. This is usually a quick, one-line message giving a brief overview of what changes have occurred between this version and the previous version. With the first commit, it is usually reasonable to just say, "First commit". Any changes after that should be detailed enough that somebody in the future (who may be you) can easily identify when certain changes were made. One way to remind yourself to do this, is to assume that the next person to look at your work is a homocidal axe murderer who knows who you are and where you live.

Git is now officially tracking changes to this file. But as you may have noticed before, there is an error in the recipe. The title of the recipe is, "Giving an Apple to a Friend", but the recipe itself states that the apple is to be given to a fiend. After this typo has been corrected, we can check Git to see how it is tracking our change.

``` diff
localhost> git diff
diff --git a/apple.yaml b/apple.yaml
index 72cd1a1..0ec3011 100644
--- a/apple.yaml
+++ b/apple.yaml
@@ -5,4 +5,4 @@ ingredients:
             - amount: 1
               unit: each
 steps:
-    - step: Give an apple to a fiend.
+    - step: Give an apple to a friend.
```

The git diff command shows us the difference between the old version of the file (a/apple.yaml) and the new version of the file (b/apple.yaml). The format that it uses tells us that any line starting with - shows a line that has been removed from the old version, and any line starting with + is a line that was added to the old version. In this case, the following line:

``` yaml
- step: Give an apple to a fiend.
```

Has been changed to this in the new version:

``` yaml
- step: Give an apple to a friend.
```

With the change in place, we may now add and commit a new version of this file.

``` shell
localhost> git add apple.yaml 
localhost> git commit -m 'Correcting typo: friend, not fiend'
[master 4f59a41] Correcting typo: friend, not fiend
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

At this point, two different versions of the file exist in the git repo. This is the important part of revision control: we can go back and look at old versions, and compare how something is done now with how it was done before. This can be especially important when doing recipe testing; somethings it helps to see how a recipe has evolved over time.

Since we've left reasonable commit messages in git, we can go back and see, at a glace, where certain changes were made.

``` shell
localhost> git log

You can see that log messages are displayed in reverse order (most recent first). If we had enough entries that this output took up more than a single screen, git would have automatically displayed it using the default paging program on your system.
