{:toc}

oven\_fan
---------

Setting to be used with convection oven. Possible values are "Off", "Low" and "High". If not specified, it is assumed to be "Off". If specified, all software should display and print this value. If not specified, it is up to the software whether or not it is displayed and/or printed, but it should be consistent.

oven\_temp
----------

Starting oven temperature, if the oven is used.

### amount

The number of degrees.

### unit

Should be C or F.

oven\_time
----------

How long the dish should spend in the oven. This is an overall value, which refers to the recipe as a whole. If multiple oven times are used, they should be specified in the recipe.

ingredients
-----------

A list of dicts, defining which food items are to be added to the recipe. These items should be listed in the order in which they are to be used. Bearing this in mind, a particular item may be listed multiple times, if it is to be used multiple times and/or at different quantities in a recipe.

To be clear, it is preferable to list "1 1/2 cups of sugar" and then "1/2 cup of sugar" (as specified below) than to list "2 cups sugar, divided".

### ingredient

A dict of items, describing an ingredient, and how much of that ingredient to use.

#### amounts

A list of dicts which describe the amounts to use. Normally, the list will only contain one dict. In cases where multiple yields need to be stored (i.e. 50 cookies vs 100 cookes vs 250 cookies), each yield will have its own dict in this list, in the same order as the recipe's yield field.

##### amount

The amount of the `unit` to use.

##### unit

The unit, relevant to the `amount`.

#### processing

A list of tags which describe the processing of this item. For instance, "whole", "large dice", "minced", "raw", "steamed", etc.

#### notes

Any notes specific to this ingredient.

#### substitutions

This field is a list of ingredients, in exactly the same format as a regular ingredient list item, minus the `substitutions` field. For instance, it must contain `amounts`, and may also contain `processing`, `usda_num`, `notes`, etc.

#### usda\_num

This corresponds with the index keys in the USDA Standard Reference. It is generally used for easy lookup of nutritional data. If possible, this should be used, and USDA data, when available, is preferable to any other nutritional data source.

notes
-----

This is a field that will appear in several locations. The recipe itself may have noted, each ingredient may have notes, and each step may have notes.

recipe\_name
------------

The name of this recipe.

recipe\_uuid
------------

This functions somewhat like a network MAC address. It needs to contain an identifier for the company or the software package, and then a unique identifier for the recipe itself. This is easiest to handle when a recipe is managed either by a website (which likely has its own internal primary keys) or a piece of commerciak software that has been registered to a user, using a registration key.

Ideally, a central source should be set up for companies to register their unique company identifier, to avoid UUID collisions.

source\_book
------------

If this recipe was originally pulled from a book, then the book information should go here. Recipe software should make an intelligent effort to include correct information in the correct fields, rather than just dumping everything into a generic notes field.

### authors

This is a list. Refers to the author(s) of this recipe. Can be the same as `source_authors`, if appropriate. If there was only one author, then they would be the only item in the list.

### title

Title of the book. This is a single value, not a list.

### isbn

International Standard Book Number, if available.

### notes

Any information about the book that does not fit into another field.

### X-&lt;field&gt;

A lot of different information about a book can be stored. Until a field has been officially accepted into the spec, it should start with a capital X, followed by a dash.

source\_authors
---------------

Does not refer to the person who entered the recipe; only refers to the original author of the recipe. If this recipe was based on another recipe by another person, then this field should contain the name of the original author.

source\_url
-----------

The URL that this recipe was copied from, if applicable. In the case of a recipe-hosting website, this may refer to the official URL at which the recipe is hosted.

steps
-----

A list, in order, of steps to be performed on the recipe. Each item in the list is a dict, as specified below.

### step

The only item in the dict that is absolutely required.

### haccp

A dict, which can contain either a `control_point` or a `critical_control_point`. Should not contain both.

#### control\_point

Refers to specific HACCP guidelines relevant to this step.

#### critical\_control\_point

Refers to specific HACCP guidelines relevant to this step, which are critical to the safety outcome of this recipe. For instance, "Cook until the food reaches an internal temperature of 165F."

### notes

A list of notes relevant to this step. Often known as "bench notes" to professionals.

yields
------

Refers to how much food the recipe makes. This is a list, which will normally contain one dict. In cases where multiple yields need to be stored (i.e. 50 cookies vs 100 cookes vs 250 cookies), each yield will have its own dict in this list.

### amount

The amount, relevant to the `unit`.

### unit

Generally "servings", but up to the user. Can be "packages", "cups", "glasses", etc.

X-&lt;field&gt;
---------------

A lot of different information about a recipe can be stored. Until a field has been officially accepted into the spec, it should start with a capital X, followed by a dash.
